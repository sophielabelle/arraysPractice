1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    - I am feeling pretty confident about sting and number arrays but less so about Boolean ones. I am not sure if I wrote the code for that correctly or not and had a difficult time googling what would be correct.

1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    - I need/ want to go over some examples with peers or instructor if possible as Googling it made me more confused.
1. What questions do you have about Arrays?
    - Boolean arrays understanding different methods a bit better. I have a basic idea but not super clear.
